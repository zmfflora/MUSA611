# Lab 2

We'll be looking at functions in this lab. In particular, we're
interested in using functions to organize our thoughts and to render our
work more readable.


#### Part 1

Open [part1-functions-are-values.html](part1-functions-are-values.html)
and follow in-comment instructions.


#### Part 2

Reopen [lab1/part4-data-transformation.html](../lab2/part4-data-transformation.html)
and reorganize the work you did there into different functions. Try to
organize your code (and your understanding of the problem!) into these
discrete tasks:
- Filtering values
- Cleaning data
- Creating and placing Leaflet objects on the map

If you get stuck, try to experiment in your console.

#### Part 3 (Stretch goal)

Functions can include loops. Try to implement a function which manages
logic related to iterating through a loop and see if you can use the
functions you wrote in part 2, above, without directly inserting those
functions into the body of your function's loop.
HINT: You will need to treat your functions as arguments to your looping
function.
