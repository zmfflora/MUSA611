# Accessing Data with Carto

| Method | Plugins | Setup | Variable SQL | Performance | Interactivity | When to Use |
|-----------------------|------------|--------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [SQL API](sqlapi) | None | Medium | Yes | Medium. Works best with a small number of points or a simple polygon or line. | High. You can access properties and assign events on features in the same way we have with other GeoJSON sources. | 1.) If you are returning a relatively simple shape; 2.) If you are using Turf.js; 3. If you are using a mapping library that supports WebGL (MapboxGL, OpenLayers3, Google Maps) |
| [createLayer](createlayer) | Cartodb.js | Medium | Yes | High | Medium. You can access properties. | You have a large or complex map layer that will need to change based on user input. Because the SQL query is exposed, you can send different SQL queries based on interaction. You don't mind using Cartodb.js and it doesn't conflict with other libraries you are using. Interactivity with the layer is important. |
| [viz.json](vizjson) | Cartodb.js | Low | No | High | Low (popups only) | You have a large or complex custom map layer that will never change with user input. You don't mind using Cartodb.js and it doesn't conflict with other libraries you are using. Interactivity with the layer isn't important beyond a popup. |
| [Named Map](namedmap) (TMS/ZXY tiles) | None | High | No | High | None | You have a large or complex custom map layer that will never change with user input. TMS tiles can be used in many mapping libraries, both on the web and on desktop applications. You can use these with the standard Leaflet library (no Cartodb.js). |
