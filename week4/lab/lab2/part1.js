# Lab 2, Part 1 â€” Underscore Selection

## Introduction

Set variables "query1" through "query8" by using an underscore function to answer the specified question. When you are finished, check your browser's console log to test the results.

For data, use the following two lists of board game collections.

var jeffGameList = ["chess", "monopoly", "sorry", "pandemic", "candyland"];

What are all of the games except for the first game in Jeff's list?
