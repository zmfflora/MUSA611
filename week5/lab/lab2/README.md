# Lab 2

#### Part 1: Plotting with external data (ajax calls)

In [part1-ajax-calls.js](js/part1-ajax-calls.js), you are asked to grab
one of three datasets we have provided at [a dataset
repository](https://github.com/CPLN690-MUSA610/datasets) on the class
github account. Simply make an ajax request for the data and log the
successful result to console.


#### Part 2: Application state: storing and removing information

In [part2-app-state.js](js/part2-app-state.js), you will be
tasked with writing a function  for removing markers from the map.
This task will require that you keep track of the markers somehow:
look to the bottom of the file

#### Part 3: Full application with user input

In [part3-application.js](js/part3-application.js), you will use
what you've learned thus far in the course to write a full application
with working user input. The user input portion of the task is handled
for you â€” all you need to do is define the appropriate functions which
are called from code that we've written. Once you've appropriately
defined the `resetMap`, `getData`, and `plotData` functions we've
provided, you should have a fully functioning application complete with
user input.

##### NOTE:

Because this is done as group work, you'll need to share the code you
write. Use github's pull-request mechanism to share finished code
between partners.
